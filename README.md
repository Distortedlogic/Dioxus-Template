# A FULL Dioxus Template Starter Repo

The goal of this repo is to provide a copy/paste starter repo for the most current version of dioxus. Most similar repos I found where either using an older Dioxus version, too simplictic to be useful with more realistic use cases, didnt include enough examples of real use case implementations, didnt provide implementations across multiple platforms, etc. So I am creating this repo to aggregate knowledge.

## System Packages

install [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) for shell scripting and [Just](https://just.systems/man/en/) for a script runner

```bash
cargo install nu just
```

### Why NuShell?

Its cross-platform making the script more agnostic by default .. No I will not write you a bat file lol

### Why Just?

It provides extra utilities for running scripts.

## Fast

```bash
just
```
